        <h2>Discover Fiji: Tropical Paradise in the South Pacific</h2>
        <p>
          Fiji is this amazing island country in the Pacific, sitting about
          2,000 km north of New Zealand. It's like something from a
          postcard—white sand, clear lagoons, and really lush landscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around a million people live there, mostly on the main island, Viti
          Levu. That's where Suva, the capital city, is located.
        </p>
        <p>
          The culture is a cool combo of Melanesian, Polynesian, and Indian.
          People speak Fijian, English, and Hindi. The locals are known for
          being super welcoming and friendly. Fiji's national motto is Rerevaka
          na Kalou ka Doka na Tui, which translates to 'Fear God and Honour the
          King/Queen'. They've had their democracy back since 2014 after being
          under military rule for a bit.
        </p>
        <h3>Nature and Climate</h3>
        <p>
          The islands have everything from coral reefs to green valleys and
          dense jungles. Mount Tomanivi is the tallest spot, at 1,323 metres.
          The weather is nice and warm all year round. Expect around 23 °C in
          winter (July-August) and about 27 °C in summer (January-March). It
          does rain some about 3,200 mm a year, and they do get hit by cyclones
          sometimes.
        </p>
        <h3>Unique Wildlife and National</h3>
        <p>
          Fiji has some interesting animals. Bats are the only local land
          mammals, and there's also the Fiji iguana—a bright green lizard that
          hangs out in trees and exists only there. They are trying to protect
          them through local efforts. The national flower is the red Tagimoucia,
          which only grows on Taveuni, and the Collared Lory (Kula) is the
          national bird, loved because it is very colourful.
        </p>
        <h3>Fiji history</h3>
        <p>
          One interesting spot is the Momi Bay Gun Battery, built in World War
          II for defense. Naihehe Caves are another place where a local tribe
          hid out way back when, and there are tons of old stories about them.
          The Garden of the Sleeping Giant, close to Nadi, presents Fiji's
          plants and gives you a bit of background on the islands' past. Fiji
          became independent from Britain on October 10, 1970, they celebrate
          Fiji Day every year.
